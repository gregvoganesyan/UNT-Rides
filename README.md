# UNT RIDES

A website that lets UNT students post their rides, denoting "To", "From", "Time", and "Price" fields of the drive. Other UNT students can request to join the ride, taking users to a confirmation page with the driver's email. The user can then contact the driver through email and set up the ride and payment.
